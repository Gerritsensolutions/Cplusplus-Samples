These two files are essentially standalone programs. They are demonstrations of the most significant steps in two key
sorting algorithms that we use commonly in computer science: merge sort and quick sort.

Combine.cpp is used in merge sort. The algorithm is repeated again and again on a seperated list to merge it together
into a sorted form.

Partition.cpp is a commonly used algorithm in quick sort that partitions a list into seperate groups. This specific
version of the algorithm uses a "pivot" point to decide where to partition the list.

To compile, simply choose one file. Each is standalone, and will compile just fine all by itself.
